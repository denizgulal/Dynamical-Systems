# Dynamical-Systems
The mathematical representation of the spread of an infectious disease using differential equations.

* ### The Question Stream is
  * First Part 
    * Setting up a system of differential equations to describe the course of S (t) and I(t).

    * Interpreting the proportionality constant in the model in biological terms. Possibility of estimate its size?
    * Reducing the system to a single differential equation. Determining the long-term behaviour of the solutions. The biological interpretation of this behaviour.
