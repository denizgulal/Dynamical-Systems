# Dynamical-Systems
The mathematical representation of the spread of an infectious disease using differential equations.

* ### The Question Stream is,
  
* (a) Set up a system of differential equations to describe the course of S (t) and I(t).

* (b) Interpret the proportionality constant in the model in biological terms. Can you
  estimate its size?
* (c) Reduce the system to a single differential equation. What is the long-term behavi-
  our of the solutions? What is the biological interpretation of this behaviour?
